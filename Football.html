  <p>The game of football takes its form. The most admitted story tells that the game was developed in England in the 12th century. In this century, games that resembled football were played on meadows and roads in England. Besides from kicks, the game involved also punches of the ball with the fist.</p>
  <p>What is the history behind football?</p>
  <p>Organized varieties of football began to take form in 19th century in English public schools. According to legend, William Webb Ellis picked up the ball and ran with it during a school football match in 1823, thus creating a new style of play in which running with the ball predominated instead of kicking.</p>
  <p>When did football start and where?</p>
  <p>American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of soccer and rugby. The first American football match was played on November 6, 1869, between two college teams, Rutgers and Princeton, using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time.</p>
  <p>What is the old name of football?</p>
  <p>Indeed, the earliest form of football is understood to be 'cuju' which was played in China during the Han dynasty from 206 BC to 220 AD. 'Cuju' translates literally as 'kick ball' and the aim of the game was to kick the ball into a net. Like later forms of the game in England, cuju outlawed the use of the hands.7 Jul 2021</p>
